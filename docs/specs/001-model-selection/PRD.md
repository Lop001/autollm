## Product Overview

### Vision
Enable GeminiAutomation users to select the optimal Gemini model for their specific task, providing transparent control over quality, performance, and cost trade-offs.

### Problem Statement
Users currently have no control over which Gemini model processes their queries, forcing them to use a single default model regardless of task complexity or budget constraints. This leads to suboptimal performance for simple tasks (over-engineering with expensive models), suboptimal quality for complex tasks (under-engineering with basic models), and inability to manage cost vs quality trade-offs. The lack of transparency about model capabilities prevents users from making informed decisions about their AI interactions.

### Value Proposition
Model selection provides immediate performance optimization by allowing users to choose the appropriate model for task complexity, delivers cost efficiency through strategic use of Flash for simple tasks and Pro for complex ones, offers user control through transparency and choice in AI model selection, and enables workflow flexibility by adapting model choice to specific use case requirements. This positions GeminiAutomation ahead of competitors by providing developer-focused model governance capabilities.

## Detailed Feature Specifications

### Feature: Basic Model Selection
**Description:** Users can select between Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini Flash Latest models through a UI element in the right panel of Gemini AI Studio before submitting their prompts. The selection persists for the session and integrates with all existing application functionality.

**User Flow:**
1. User launches GeminiAutomation application
2. System opens Gemini AI Studio and displays model selection UI in right panel
3. User clicks on model selector dropdown/interface
4. System displays available models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini Flash Latest)
5. User selects desired model
6. System confirms selection and updates UI to show active model
7. User enters prompt and submits
8. System processes query using selected model
9. System displays response with model attribution

**Business Rules:**
- Rule 1: Model selection must be completed before prompt submission - system blocks submission until model is selected
- Rule 2: When no explicit selection is made, system defaults to Gemini Flash Latest for cost efficiency
- Rule 3: Model selection persists within the browser session but resets on application restart
- Rule 4: Selected model information is captured in debug screenshots for troubleshooting
- Rule 5: Model selection works with existing session management and authentication features
- Rule 6: Browser automation must handle dynamic UI elements for model selection

**Edge Cases:**
- Scenario 1: Selected model becomes unavailable → Expected: System displays error message and reverts to default model
- Scenario 2: Model selection UI fails to load → Expected: System continues with default model and logs warning
- Scenario 3: User switches models mid-session → Expected: New selection applies to subsequent queries only
- Scenario 4: Network timeout during model selection → Expected: System retries selection or uses last known good selection
- Scenario 5: Multiple model selectors appear on page → Expected: System identifies correct selector using priority-based detection
- Scenario 6: Model selection conflicts with existing session → Expected: New selection overrides previous choice with user notification

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Adoption:** 60% of users actively use model selection within 30 days
- **Engagement:** 80% of sessions include explicit model selection (vs default)
- **Quality:** 98% model selection success rate with <3 second response time

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Technical Constraints:** Limited to Gemini models available through Google AI Studio web interface
- **Platform Constraints:** Dependent on Google's UI stability and element selector availability
- **Browser Automation Constraints:** Model selection must work with existing Playwright automation framework
- **Timeline Constraints:** Must integrate with existing codebase without breaking current functionality
- **Resource Constraints:** Implementation must leverage existing browser automation patterns and session management

### Assumptions

- **User Assumptions:** Users have basic understanding of AI model differences, users want control over model selection, users will adapt to slightly modified workflow
- **Market Assumptions:** Google will maintain current model offerings and UI structure, model selection interfaces will remain accessible via browser automation
- **Technical Assumptions:** Gemini AI Studio UI elements will be selectable via standard web selectors, model switching will not require additional authentication, existing session management will work with model selection

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Google changes UI structure breaking selectors | High | Medium | Implement multiple fallback selectors, add UI monitoring alerts, maintain selector update strategy |
| Model selection adds significant latency | Medium | Low | Optimize selection logic, implement caching, add performance monitoring |
| Users confused by model choice | Medium | Medium | Provide clear model descriptions, implement auto-selection as fallback, add user guidance |
| Feature adoption lower than expected | Medium | Medium | Implement progressive disclosure, add user education, provide clear value demonstration |
| Browser automation becomes unreliable | High | Low | Implement robust error handling, add retry mechanisms, provide manual fallback options |
| Cost optimization doesn't materialize | Low | Low | Track actual usage patterns, adjust recommendations, provide cost transparency |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should model selection be persistent across application restarts or reset each time?
- [ ] What should be the default model when user makes no selection (Pro for quality vs Flash for cost)?
- [ ] Should we display estimated cost/performance metrics alongside model names?
- [ ] How should we handle model availability changes (new models added, existing models deprecated)?
- [ ] Should command-line model selection override web UI selection or work independently?
- [ ] What level of user guidance is needed for model selection (tooltips, help text, examples)?
