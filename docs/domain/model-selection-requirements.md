# Model Selection Domain Requirements

## Business Context

The GeminiAutomation application currently provides no model selection capability, forcing all users to use a single default model regardless of their specific needs, use cases, or cost considerations.

## User Personas and Needs

### Primary Persona: Developer/Automation Engineer
- **Demographics**: Technical professionals, 25-45 years, high technical expertise
- **Goals**: Optimize query performance and cost for different automation tasks
- **Pain Points**: Forced to use one model regardless of task complexity or budget constraints

### Secondary Persona: Content Creator/Writer  
- **Demographics**: Content professionals, 20-50 years, medium technical expertise
- **Goals**: Balance quality and speed for different content generation needs
- **Pain Points**: No control over response quality vs speed trade-offs

### Tertiary Persona: Researcher/Analyst
- **Demographics**: Research professionals, 25-55 years, medium to high technical expertise  
- **Goals**: Choose appropriate model based on research complexity and depth requirements
- **Pain Points**: Limited ability to optimize for specific research methodologies

## Problem Statement

Users currently have no control over which Gemini model processes their queries, leading to:
- Suboptimal performance for simple tasks (over-engineering with expensive models)
- Suboptimal quality for complex tasks (under-engineering with basic models)
- Inability to manage cost vs quality trade-offs
- Lack of transparency about model capabilities

## Value Proposition

Model selection provides:
- **Performance Optimization**: Choose appropriate model for task complexity
- **Cost Efficiency**: Use Flash for simple tasks, Pro for complex ones
- **User Control**: Transparency and choice in AI model selection
- **Workflow Flexibility**: Adapt model choice to specific use case requirements

## Key Business Rules

1. **Model Availability**: Support for "Gemini 2.5 Pro" and "Gemini Flash Latest"
2. **Selection Timing**: Model must be selected before prompt submission
3. **UI Location**: Selection interface in right panel of Gemini AI Studio
4. **Persistence**: Model selection should persist within session
5. **Default Behavior**: System should provide sensible default when no selection made
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when selected model unavailable

## Success Criteria

- 60% feature adoption within 30 days
- 98% technical reliability
- 20% cost reduction through optimized model usage  
- 80% user retention among feature adopters
